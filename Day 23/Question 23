Anagram checker

Write a function areAnagrams(strOne, strTwo),
which takes two strings: strOne and strTwo as arguments.
The function should return true if
the two strings are anagrams and false otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the
letters of another word or phrase. In other words,
two strings are considered anagrams if they have
exactly the same characters but in a different order.

NOTE: The function areAnagrams should be case-insensitive

Example test cases
areAnagrams('cinema', 'iceman'); // Output: true
areAnagrams('restful', 'fluster'); // Output: true
areAnagrams('hello', 'world'); // Output: false
Hints
You should start by converting both strings to either lowercase or UPPERCASE.
This will make it easier to compare them.
Once both strings are in the same case, you can find a way to use
.sort() method on them. Keep in mind that .sort() can only be used on arrays.

Challenge:
areAnagrams should return true for single words.
areAnagrams should return true for anagram words with spaces.
areAnagrams should return true for anagram words with spaces.
areAnagrams should return true for anagram digits.
areAnagrams should return false for non-anagram words.
areAnagrams should return false for non-anagram words.
