Capitalise all words

In this coding challenge, you will be implementing a custom capitaliseAllWords(input) function.
The function should take one string argument called input.
The input string can consist of one or more words separated by a white space (just like a regular sentence).
The function should capitalise all of the words in the string.
Keep in mind that the input string can include numbers and special characters.

Instructions
Your function should return a new string.
If the input is an empty string, then return an empty string.
The input will always be a valid sentence.
Example test cases
capitaliseAllWords("hello world! 123") // Output: "Hello World! 123"
capitaliseAllWords("how are you mate") // Output: "How Are You Mate"
capitaliseAllWords("aNGELA tHE cAT lADY") // Output: "ANGELA THE CAT LADY"
Hints
You may need to chain multiple methods.
Use the split method to split the input string.
