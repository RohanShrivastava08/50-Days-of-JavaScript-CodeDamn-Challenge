Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays

In this lab, your task is to implement the findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d)
function. The function takes three inputs:

Two integer arrays: arr1 and arr2
An integer: d
The function should return the distance value between the two arrays as defined below.

Function Definition
The distance value is the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is
not any element arr2[j] where the absolute difference |arr1[i] - arr2[j]| is less than or equal to d.

function findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) {
  // Your implementation here
}

Challenges:
Implement the findTheDistanceValue function - Make sure to implement the findTheDistanceValue function as described in the lab description.
The function should accept three parameters: arr1, arr2, and d, and return the distance value between the arrays.

Export the findTheDistanceValue function correctly - Ensure that the findTheDistanceValue function is exported using ESM syntax.
The evaluation script will import and test your function, so make sure it is correctly exported to avoid any issues.
