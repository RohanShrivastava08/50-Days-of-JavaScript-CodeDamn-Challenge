Leap

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

Challenges:
Year not divisible by 4 in common year.
Year divisible by 2, not divisible by 4 in common year.
Year divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 in leap year.
Year divisible by 4 and 5 is still a leap year.
Year divisible by 100, not divisible by 400 in common year.
Year divisible by 100 but not by 3 is still not a leap year.
Year divisible by 400 in leap year.
Year divisible by 400 but not by 125 is still a leap year.
Year divisible by 200, not divisible by 400 in common year.
