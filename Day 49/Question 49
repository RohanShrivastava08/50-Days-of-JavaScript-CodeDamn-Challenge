Singleton Design Pattern in JavaScript

In this lab, you will learn and implement the Singleton design pattern in JavaScript.
A Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance
and provides a global point of access to it. Use ES6 class syntax to create the Singleton class.

Your task is to create a Singleton class with a getInstance method,
ensure that only one instance of the class is created,
and provide a method named message that returns 'Hello Singleton!' when called.

Challenges:
Create a Singleton class with a getInstance method.
Implement a message method that returns 'Hello Singleton!'.
Create only one instance of the Singleton class.
Export the Singleton class as the default export.
