the currency rate for given currecy code from the input.

Your app will make a GET request to the API 'https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD' to
fetch the latest exchange rate for USD.
The fetched data will be in JSON format.
Your task is to display the conversion rate for the
currency entered by the user in the #currencyInput field.

letters and will only accept if the length of the input is 3 letters.
This validation is done using a regular expression added to the pattern attribute of the input element

`1 USD = ${currecyRate} ${currecyCode}`
