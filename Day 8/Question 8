Q. Sum every third number

Write a function sumOfThirds(arr),
which takes an array arr as an argument.
This function should return a sum of every third
number in the array,
starting from the first one.

Instructions
If the input array is empty or contains
less than 3 numbers then return 0.
The input array will contain only numbers.

Example test cases
sumOfThirds([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]); // Output: 6
sumOfThirds([]); // Output: 0
sumOfThirds([-5, 0, 5, -4, 1, 6, -3, 2, 7]); // Output: -12

Hints
You can use the built-in method .reduce().
