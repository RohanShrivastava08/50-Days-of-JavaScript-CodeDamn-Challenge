Using spread operator in function parameter

In this lab, you will create a JavaScript function called sum
that uses the spread operator when defining the paramemter args to accept
any number of arguments and calculates their sum.
The function should be exported for testing purposes.

JavaScript's spread operator (...) allows you to expand iterable
elements like arrays or strings. It's useful when you want to collect any number
of arguments passed to a function or when you want to spread elements among
different arrays or objects.

Challenge:
Create a function named sum.
Use the spread operator in the sum function's definition to accept n number of arguments.
Calculate the sum of all passed arguments.
Export the sum function using ESM syntax.
