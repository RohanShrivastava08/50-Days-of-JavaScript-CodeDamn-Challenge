Inheritance in JavaScript

In this lab, you are going to apply the concept of inheritance
by creating classes and their relationship in JavaScript.
First, you will create a Person class with properties 'firstName' and 'lastName'.
Then, create a method 'fullName()' that returns the full name of the person.

After that, create another class Employee that inherits from the Person class.
Add new properties 'position' and 'salary' to this derived class.
Finally, create a 'toString()' method that returns the string representation of the Employee object.

Challenges:
Implement a 'fullName()' method for the Person class
Create a class 'Employee' and inherit from 'Person'.
Add properties 'position' and 'salary'
Implement a 'toString()' method for the Employee class
