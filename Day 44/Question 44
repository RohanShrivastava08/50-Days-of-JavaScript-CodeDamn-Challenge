JavaScript Promise Chaining Lab

In this lab, you will practice using JavaScript Promises in a chain format.
You will create two functions - fetchData and processData.
The fetchData function will simulate fetching data using a Promise and
do so with a 1-second delay.
The processData function will take this data and process it,
once again delaying this operation by 1 second using a Promise.
Your task is to implement the fetchData and processData functions and
export the functions correctly and chain them together to produce the final output.

Challenges:
Create a function named 'fetchData' that returns a Promise. Make sure to export the function.
Make sure 'fetchData' function resolves with the string 'data fetched!' after 1 second.
Create a function named 'processData' that takes data as an argument and returns a new Promise. Make sure to export the function
Make sure 'processData' function resolves with the input data concatenated with the string ' - processed!' after 1 second.
