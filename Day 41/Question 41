JavaScript String Methods Lab

In this lab, you will practice using JavaScript string methods by implementing
four different functions that manipulate and analyze strings.
Use ESM syntax to create and export the functions from your index.js file.
Work directly within the provided boilerplates to complete the challenges!

Challenges:
Create a function reverseString that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed string.
Create a function capitalizeFirstLetters that takes a string as an argument and capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Create a function findLongestWord that takes a string as an argument and returns the longest word.
Create a function wordCount that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of words in the string.
