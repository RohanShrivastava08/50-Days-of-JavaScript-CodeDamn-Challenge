Sum Even Numbers

Write a function sumOfEvens(arr),
which takes an array arr as an argument.
This function should return a sum of every even number in the array.

Instructions:
If the input array is empty or there are no even numbers,
then return 0.
The input array will contain only numbers.
Example test cases
sumOfEvens([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
// Output: 6
sumOfEvens([]);
// Output: 0
sumOfEvens([-5, 0, 5, -4, 1, 6, -3, 2, 7]);
// Output: 8

Hint:
You can use the built-in method .reduce() or a for loop.
Make sure you export the function for writing the tests.
