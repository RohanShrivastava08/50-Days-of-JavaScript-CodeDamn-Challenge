Map, Filter, and Reduce Lab

In this lab, you will implement your own map,
filter, and reduce functions in JavaScript.
These functions are commonly used for array manipulation in JavaScript.
Map, filter, and reduce functions are higher-order functions that accept a
callback function as an argument and apply that function to the
elements of the input array in different ways.

By the end of this lab, you should have 3 functional
implementations for map, filter, and reduce.

Make sure to export all the functions using ESM export.

Challenge:
Export the myMap, myFilter, and myReduce functions as named exports from index.js using ESM syntax.
Create a map function myMap in index.js that accepts an array and a callback function as arguments
and returns a new array after applying the callback function to each element of the original array.
Create a filter function myFilter in index.js that accepts an array and a callback function as arguments
and returns a new array consisting of elements that meet the condition specified in the callback function.
Create a reduce function myReduce in index.js that accepts an array,
a callback function, and an optional initialValue as arguments, 
and returns a single value after applying the callback function to each element of the array.
